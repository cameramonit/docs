What is CCTV movement and angle view change detection system?
CCTV movement and angle view change detection system runs on Raco Edge AI Gateway to increase safety at the monitored property and make a security system more effective. The system recognizes all kinds of camera movements, displacements and field of view changes, reacting to unusual activities. Security guards receive an on-screen notification of any attempt to change the camera angle or cover the lens to gain more time for immediate reaction. The system works indoors, outdoors and at night if the camera has a night vision mode.

Example business scenarios:
– Camera displacement recognition,
– Supporting security guards during the night shift,
– More effective monitoring of supervised premises,
– Preventing attempts to steal valuable belongings,
– Increasing the safety of buildings and properties.
