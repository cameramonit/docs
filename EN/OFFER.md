The transition from industry 4.0-6.0 is premised on data driven innovations. What this means is laws laws governing and regulating the use of data have become very important. Zimbabwe responded by enacting the Cyber and Data Protection Act. Data has become a commodity for sale, in particular personal data. There is an increase in private automated CCTVs in Harare.
Why is this a threat to the existing legal framework? There is indiscriminate capture of data relating to individuals. This is dangerous especially with the lack of regulation of AI driven tech. This data is important for biometric surveillance which is dependent on unique biological features and utilises Automated Facial Recognition Technology to track persons of interest. AI in collaboration with the Cyber physical space is a threat to the right to privacy and dignity and Zimbabwe should be taking steps to regulate this area.

Moving forward, we should regulate retention of indiscriminate data collected by private stakeholders for their own purposes because it is collected without the consent of the citizens. This is pervasive and violates the right to consent as well as the disclosure of purpose for data collection in a particular context.
